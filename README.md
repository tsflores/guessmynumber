For this assignment, divided the activities into several modules each representing some aspect of the single page application.
1.  App.js uses simple component of routes that then gets rendered when exported
2.  Storing initial values of relevant data items in 2 arrays that get imported into the appropriate module
3.  The data items include the number of allowable attempts per game, the range the answer falls within, and statisics for the game
4.  The game contains three pages - Home, Stats, and Info - each one as a separate module for ease of modifiying in the future
5.  Text box and button to allow user to enter and check a guess
6.  A counter to display how many guesses per game are remaining
7.  Once the game ends (win or lose), the text box is disabled and the submit button changes to allow user to start a new game
8.  Statistics are stored for every game played and are only reset if the app is reloaded.
